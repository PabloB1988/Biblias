# Archive Directory

This directory contains files that were used during the development process but are no longer needed for the main application.

## Contents:

1. **JohnWesleyNotes_thml.json** - An incomplete conversion of John Wesley's Notes using a basic ThML parser
2. **JohnWesleyNotes.json** - Another incomplete conversion of John Wesley's Notes (in two locations)
3. **README_WESLEY_NOTES.md** - Documentation created during the initial conversion process
4. **README_COMPLETO.md** - General documentation about all Bible files
5. **xml_to_json_converter.py** - Original converter script for Bible XML files
6. **.DS_Store** - System file from macOS

## Active Files:

The active files that contain the complete data are:
- `json_files/commentaries/JohnWesleyNotes_complete.json` - Complete conversion of John Wesley's Notes with all verse-by-verse commentary
- All other JSON files in `json_files/` and `json_files/commentaries/` directories

## Reason for Archiving:

These files were moved to the archive because:
1. They contain incomplete or outdated conversions
2. They were used during development but are no longer needed
3. They were documentation files created during the process
4. Keeping them separate maintains a clean working directory
