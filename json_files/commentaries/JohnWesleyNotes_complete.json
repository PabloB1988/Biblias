This title\ntherefore properly relates to the verses that immediately follow: but as\nit sometimes signifies the history of a person, in that sense it may\nbelong to the whole book. If there were any difficulties in this\ngenealogy, or that given by St. Luke, which could not easily be removed,\nthey would rather affect the Jewish tables, than the credit of the\nevangelists: for they act only as historians setting down these\ngenealogies, as they stood in those public and allowed records.\nTherefore they were to take them as they found them. Nor was it needful\nthey should correct the mistakes, if there were any. For these accounts\nsufficiently answer the end for which they are recited. They\nunquestionably prove the grand point in view, that Jesus was of the\nfamily from which the promised seed was to come. And they had more\nweight with the Jews for this purpose, than if alterations had been made\nby inspiration itself. For such alterations would have occasioned\nendless disputes between them and the disciples of our Lord. The son of\nDavid, the son of Abraham - He is so called, because to these he was\nmore peculiarly promised; and of these it was often foretold the Messiah\nshould spring. Luke iii, 31."

Jesus, who is called Christ - The name Jesus respects\nchiefly the promise of blessing made to Abraham: the name Christ, the\npromise of the Messiah's kingdom, which was made to David. It may be\nfurther observed, that the word Christ in Greek, and Messiah in Hebrews,\nsignify anointed, and imply the prophetic, priestly, and royal\ncharacters, which were to meet in the Messiah. Among the Jews, anointing\nwas the ceremony whereby prophets, priests, and kings were initiated\ninto those offices. And if we look into ourselves, we shall find a want\nof Christ in all these respects. We are by nature at a distance from\nGod, alienated from him, and incapable of a free access to him. Hence we\nwant a mediator, an intercessor, in a word, a Christ, in his priestly\noffice. This regards our state with respect to God. And with respect to\nourselves, we find a total darkness, blindness, ignorance of God, and\nthe things of God. Now here we want Christ in his prophetic office, to\nenlighten our minds, and teach us the whole will of God. We find also\nwithin us a strange misrule of appetites and passions. For these we want\nChrist in his royal character, to reign in our hearts, and subdue all\nthings to himself."

When we survey such a series of generations, it is a natural\nand obvious reflection, how like the leaves of a tree one passeth away,\nand another cometh! Yet the earth still abideth. And with it the\ngoodness of the Lord which runs from generation to generation, the\ncommon hope of parents and children. Of those who formerly lived upon\nearth, and perhaps made the most conspicuous figure, how many are there\nwhose names are perished with them? How many, of whom only the names are\nremaining?

Happy world, were this plain and necessary distinction\nthoroughly understood, remembered, practiced! Raca means, a silly man, a\ntrifler. Whosoever shall say, Thou fool - Shall revile, or seriously\nreproach any man. Our Lord specified three degrees of murder, each\nliable to a sorer punishment than the other: not indeed from men, but\nfrom God. Hell fire - In the valley of Hinnom (whence the word in the\noriginal is taken) the children were used to be burnt alive to Moloch.\nIt was afterward made a receptacle for the filth of the city, where\ncontinual fires were kept to consume it. And it is probable, if any\ncriminals were burnt alive, it was in this accursed and horrible place.\nTherefore both as to its former and latter state, it was a fit emblem of\nhell. It must here signify a degree of future punishment, as much more\ndreadful than those incurred in the two former cases, as burning alive\nis more dreadful than either strangling or stoning."

Cast out devils - It is a great relief to the spirits of\nan infidel, sinking under a dread, that possibly the Gospel may be true,\nto find it observed by a learned brother, that the diseases therein\nascribed to the operation of the devil have the very same symptoms with\nthe natural diseases of lunacy, epilepsy, or convulsions; whence he\nreadily and very willingly concludes, that the devil had no hand in\nthem. But it were well to stop and consider a little. Suppose God should\nsuffer an evil spirit to usurp the same power over a man's body, as the\nman himself has naturally; and suppose him actually to exercise that\npower; could we conclude the devil had no hand therein, because his body\nwas bent in the very same manner wherein the man himself might have bent\nit naturally? And suppose God gives an evil spirit a greater power, to\neffect immediately the organ of the nerves in the brain, by irritating\nthem to produce violent motions, or so relaxing them that they can\nproduce little or no motion; still the symptoms will be those of over\ntense nerves, as in madness, epilepsies, convulsions; or of relaxed\nnerves, as in paralytic cases. But could we conclude thence that the\ndevil had no hand in them? Will any man affirm that God cannot or will\nnot, on any occasion whatever, give such a power to an evil spirit? Or\nthat effects, the like of which may be produced by natural causes,\ncannot possibly be produced by preternatural? If this be possible, then\nhe who affirms it was so, in any particular case, cannot be justly\ncharged with falsehood, merely for affirming the reality of a possible\nthing. Yet in this manner are the evangelists treated by those unhappy\nmen, who above all things dread the truth of the Gospel, because, if it\nis true, they are of all men the most miserable. Freely ye have received\n- All things; in particular the power of working miracles; freely give -\nExert that power wherever you come. Mark\nvi, 7; Luke ix,\n2."

Let us remember then (what can never be sufficiently\ninculcated) that God is the author of all events: that none is so small\nor inconsiderable, as to escape his notice and direction. Every event\ntherefore declares to us the will of God, to which thus declared we\nshould heartily submit. We should renounce our own to embrace it; we\nshould approve and choose what his choice warrants as best for us.\nHerein should we exercise ourselves continually; this should be our\npractice all the day long. We should in humility accept the little\ncrosses that are dispensed to us, as those that best suit our weakness.\nLet us bear these little things, at least for God's sake, and prefer his\nwill to our own in matters of so small importance. And his goodness will\naccept these mean oblations; for he despiseth not the day of small\nthings. Matt. x, 38."

Our\nLord in this whole parable shows, not only that the Jews had no cause to\nmurmur at the reception of the Gentiles, (a point which did not at that\ntime so directly fall under consideration, ) but that if the Pharisees\nwere indeed as good as they fancied themselves to be, still they had no\nreason to murmur at the kind treatment of any sincere penitent. Thus\ndoes he condemn them, even on their own principles, and so leaves them\nwithout excuse. We have in this parable a lively emblem of the condition\nand behaviour of sinners in their natural state. Thus, when enriched by\nthe bounty of the great common Father, do they ungratefully run from\nhim, ver. 12. Sensual pleasures are eagerly pursued, till they have\nsquandered away all the grace of God, ver. 13. And while these continue,\nnot a serious thought of God can find a place in their minds. And even\nwhen afflictions come upon them, ver. 14, still they will make hard\nshifts before they will let the grace of God, concurring with his\nprovidence, persuade them to think of a return, ver. 15, 16. When they\nsee themselves naked, indigent, and undone, then they recover the\nexercise of their reason, ver. 17. Then they remember the blessings they\nhave thrown away, and attend to the misery they have incurred. And\nhereupon they resolve to return to their father, and put the resolution\nimmediately in practice, ver. 18, 19. Behold with wonder and pleasure\nthe gracious reception they find from Divine, injured goodness! When\nsuch a prodigal comes to his father, he sees him afar off, ver. 20. He\npities, meets, embraces him, and interrupts his acknowledgments with the\ntokens of his returning favour, ver. 21. He arrays him with the robe of\na Redeemer's righteousness, with inward and outward holiness; adorns him\nwith all his sanctifying graces, and honours him with the tokens of\nadopting love, ver. 22. And all this he does with unutterable delight,\nin that he who was lost is now found, ver. 23, 24. Let no elder brother\nmurmur at this indulgence, but rather welcome the prodigal back into the\nfamily. And let those who have been thus received, wander no more, but\nemulate the strictest piety of those who for many years have served\ntheir heavenly Father, and not transgressed his commandments."

When all things began to be made by the Word: in the\nbeginning of heaven and earth, and this whole frame of created beings,\nthe Word existed, without any beginning. He was when all things began to\nbe, whatsoever had a beginning. The Word - So termed Psalm xxxiii, 6, and frequently by the seventy, and in the Chaldee\nparaphrase. So that St. John did not borrow this expression from Philo,\nor any heathen writer. He was not yet named Jesus, or Christ. He is the\nWord whom the Father begat or spoke from eternity; by whom the Father\nspeaking, maketh all things; who speaketh the Father to us. We have, in\nthe 18th verse, both a real description of the Word, and the reason why\nhe is so called. He is the only begotten Son of the Father, who is in\nthe bosom of the Father, and hath declared him. And the Word was with\nGod - Therefore distinct from God the Father. The word rendered with,\ndenotes a perpetual tendency as it were of the Son to the Father, in\nunity of essence. He was with God alone; because nothing beside God had\nthen any being. And the Word was God - Supreme, eternal, independent.\nThere was no creature, in respect of which he could be styled God in a\nrelative sense. Therefore he is styled so in the absolute sense. The\nGodhead of the Messiah being clearly revealed in the Old Testament, (Jer. xxiii, 7; Hosea i, 6; Psalm xxiii, 1, ) the other evangelists aim at this, to prove that Jesus, a\ntrue man, was the Messiah. But when, at length, some from hence began to\ndoubt of his Godhead, then St. John expressly asserted it, and wrote in\nthis book as it were a supplement to the Gospels, as in the Revelation\nto the prophets."

And he did not make us a transient\nvisit, but tabernacled among us on earth, displaying his glory in a more\neminent manner, than even of old in the tabernacle of Moses. And we who\nare now recording these things beheld his glory with so strict an\nattention, that we can testify, it was in every respect such a glory as\nbecame the only begotten of the Father. For it shone forth not only in\nhis transfiguration, and in his continual miracles, but in all his\ntempers, ministrations, and conduct through the whole series of his\nlife. In all he appeared full of grace and truth: he was himself most\nbenevolent and upright; made those ample discoveries of pardon to\nsinners, which the Mosaic dispensation could not do: and really\nexhibited the most substantial blessings, whereas that was but a shadow\nof good things to come."

And he said - St. Stephen had been accused of blasphemy\nagainst Moses, and even against God; and of speaking against the temple\nand the law, threatening that Jesus would destroy the one, and change\nthe other. In answer to this accusation, rehearsing as it were the\narticles of his historical creed, he speaks of God with high reverence,\nand a grateful sense of a long series of acts of goodness to the\nIsraelites, and of Moses with great respect, on account of his important\nand honourable employments under God: of the temple with regard, as\nbeing built to the honour of God; yet not with such superstition as the\nJews; putting them in mind, that no temple could comprehend God. And he\nwas going on, no doubt, when he was interrupted by their clamour, to\nspeak to the last point, the destruction of the temple, and the change\nof the law by Christ. Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken - The sum of\nhis discourse is this: I acknowledge the glory of God revealed to the\nfathers, ver. 2; the calling of Moses, ver. 34, &c.; the dignity of\nthe law, verses 8, 38, 44; the holiness of this place, verses 7, 45, 47.\nAnd indeed the law is more ancient than the temple; the promise more\nancient than the law. For God showed himself the God of Abraham, Isaac,\nJacob, and their children freely, ver. 2, &c.; 9, &c.;\n17,&c.; 32, 34, 35; and they showed faith and obedience to God, ver.\n4, 20, &c., 23, particularly by their regard for the law, ver. 8,\nand the promised land, ver. 16. Meantime, God never confined his\npresence to this one place or to the observers of the law. For he hath\nbeen acceptably worshipped before the law was given, or the temple\nbuilt, and out of this land, ver. 2, 9, 33, 44. And that our fathers and\ntheir posterity were not tied down to this land, their various\nsojournings, ver. 4, &c.; 14, 29, 44, and exile, ver. 43, show. But\nyou and your fathers have always been evil, ver. 9; have withstood\nMoses, ver. 25, &c., 39, &c.; have despised the land, ver. 39,\nforsaken God, ver. 40, &c., superstitiously honoured the temple,\nver. 48, resisted God and his Spirit, ver. 50, killed the prophets and\nthe Messiah himself, ver. 51, and kept not the law for which ye contend,\nver. 53. Therefore God is not bound to you; much less to you alone. And\ntruly this solemn testimony of Stephen is most worthy of his character,\nas a man full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith and power: in which,\nthough he does not advance so many regular propositions, contradictory\nto those of his adversaries, yet he closely and nervously answers them\nall. Nor can we doubt but he would, from these premises, have drawn\ninferences touching the destruction of the temple, the abrogation of the\nMosaic law, the punishment of that rebellious people; and above all,\ntouching Jesus of Nazareth, the true Messiah, had not his discourse been\ninterrupted by the clamours of the multitude, stopping their ears, and\nrushing upon him. Men, brethren, and fathers - All who are here present,\nwhether ye are my equals in years, or of more advanced age. The word\nwhich in this and in many other places is rendered men is a mere\nexpletive. The God of glory - The glorious God, appeared to Abraham\nbefore he dwelt in Haran - Therefore Abraham knew God, long before he\nwas in this land. Gen. xii,\n1."

Not\nthat God rejected the rest: it was his will that they also should have\nbeen saved: but they thrust salvation from them. Nor were they who then\nbelieved constrained to believe.

To them\nthat are called according to his purpose - His gracious design of saving\na lost world by the death of his Son. This is a new proposition. St.\nPaul, being about to recapitulate the whole blessing contained in\njustification, (termed \"glorification,\" ver. 30,) first goes back to the\npurpose or decree of God, which is frequently mentioned in holy writ. To\nexplain this (nearly in the words of an eminent writer) a little more at\nlarge:-When a man has a work of time and importance before him, he\npauses, consults, and contrives; and when he has laid a plan, resolves\nor decrees to proceed accordingly. Having observed this in ourselves, we\nare ready to apply it to God also; and he, in condescension to us has\napplied it to himself. The works of providence and redemption are vast\nand stupendous, and therefore we are apt to conceive of God as\ndeliberating and consulting on them, and then decreeing to act according\nto \"the counsel of his own will;\" as if, long before the world was made,\nhe had been concerting measures both as to the making and governing of\nit, and had then writ down his decrees, which altered not, any more than\nthe laws of the Medes and Persians. Whereas, to take this consulting and\ndecreeing in a literal sense, would be the same absurdity as to ascribe\na real human body and human passions to the ever-blessed God. This is\nonly a popular representation of his infallible knowledge and\nunchangeable wisdom; that is, he does all things as wisely as a man can\npossibly do, after the deepest consultation, and as steadily pursues the\nmost proper method as one can do who has laid a scheme beforehand. But\nthen, though the effects be such as would argue consultation and\nconsequent decrees in man, yet what need of a moment's consultation in\nHim who sees all things at one view? Nor had God any more occasion to\npause and deliberate, and lay down rules for his own conduct from all\neternity, than he has now. What was there any fear of his mistaking\nafterwards, if he had not beforehand prepared decrees, to direct him\nwhat he was to do? Will any man say, he was wiser before the creation\nthan since? or had he then more leisure, that he should take that\nopportunity to settle his affairs, and make rules (or himself, from\nwhich he was never to vary? He has doubtless the same wisdom and all\nother perfections at this day which he had from eternity; and is now as\ncapable of making decrees, or rather has no more occasion for them now\nthan formerly: his understanding being always equally clear and bright,\nhis wisdom equally infallible."

But the nation of\nthe Jews were chosen to be the people of God, and were therefore styled,\n\"the children\" or \"sons of God,\" Deut.\nxiv, 1; \"holy people,\" Deut. vii, 6; xiv,\n2; \"a chosen seed,\" Deut.\niv, 37; \"the elect,\" Isaiah xli, 8, 9; xliii,\n10; \"the called of God,\" Isaiah xlviii, 12. And these titles were given to all the nation of Israel,\nincluding both good and bad. Now the gospel having the most strict\nconnection with the Books of the Old Testament, where these phrases\nfrequently occur; and our Lord and his apostles being native Jews, and\nbeginning to preach in the land of Israel, the language in which they\npreached would of course abound with the phrases of the Jewish nation.\nAnd hence it is easy to see why such of them as would not receive him\nwere styled reprobated. For they no longer continued to be the people of\nGod; whereas this and those other honourable titles were continued to\nall such Jews as embraced Christianity. And the same appellations which\nonce belonged to the Jewish nation were now given to the gentile\nChristians also together with which they were invested with all the\nprivileges of \"the chosen people of God;\" and nothing could cut them off\nfrom these but their own wilful apostasy. It does not appear that even\ngood men were ever termed God's elect till above two thousand years from\nthe creation. God's electing or choosing the nation of Israel, and\nseparating them from the other nations, who were sunk in idolatry and\nall wickedness, gave the first occasion to this sort of language. And as\nthe separating the Christians from the Jews was a like event, no wonder\nit was expressed in like words and phrases only with this difference,\nthe term elect was of old applied to all the members of the visible\nchurch; whereas in the New Testament it is applied only to the members\nof the invisible."

And it is in the same sense that the word\nis used, chap. i, 10; chap. xii, 25; which are the only places in the\nNew Testament, beside this, where church schisms are mentioned.\nTherefore, the indulging any temper contrary to this tender care of each\nother is the true scriptural schism. This is, therefore, a quite\ndifferent thing from that orderly separation from corrupt churches which\nlater ages have stigmatized as schisms; and have made a pretense for the\nvilest cruelties, oppressions, and murders, that have troubled the\nChristian world. Both heresies and schisms are here mentioned in very\nnear the same sense; unless by schisms be meant, rather, those inward\nanimosities which occasion heresies; that is, outward divisions or\nparties: so that whilst one said, \"I am of Paul,\" another, \"I am of\nApollos,\" this implied both schism and heresy. So wonderfully have later\nages distorted the words heresy and schism from their scriptural\nmeaning. Heresy is not, in all the Bible, taken for \"an error in\nfundamentals,\" or in anything else; nor schism, for any separation made\nfrom the outward communion of others. Therefore, both heresy and schism,\nin the modern sense of the words, are sins that the scripture knows\nnothing of; but were invented merely to deprive mankind of the benefit\nof private judgment, and liberty of conscience."

And they are\nnot always placed promiscuously; but generally in a more solemn way of\nspeaking, the Apostle says, Christ Jesus; in a more familiar, Jesus\nChrist. Even we - And how much more must the Gentiles, who have still\nless pretense to depend on their own works! Have believed - Knowing\nthere is no other way. Because - Considering the demands of the law, and\nthe fate of human nature, it is evident, that by the works of the law -\nBy such an obedience as it requires. Shall no flesh living - No human\ncreature, Jew or Gentile, be justified. Hitherto St. Paul had been\nconsidering that single question, \"Are Christians obliged to observe the\nceremonial law? But he here insensibly goes farther, and, by citing this\nscripture, shows that what he spoke directly of the ceremonial, included\nalso the moral, law. For David undoubtedly did so, when he said, Psalm cxliii, 2, the place here referred to, \"In thy sight shall no man\nliving be justified;\" which the Apostle likewise explains, Rom. iii, 19, 20, in such a manner as can agree to none but the moral\nlaw."

St. Paul had taught that \"a man is justified by faith\nwithout the works of the law.\" This some began already to wrest to their\nown destruction. Wherefore St. James, purposely repeating (ver. 21, 23,\n25) the same phrases, testimonies, and examples, which St. Paul had\nused, Rom. iv, 3, Heb. xi, 17, 31, refutes not the doctrine of St. Paul, but the error of\nthose who abused it. There is, therefore, no contradiction between the\napostles: they both delivered the truth of God, but in a different\nmanner, as having to do with different kinds of men. On another occasion\nSt. James himself pleaded the cause of faith, Acts xv, 13-21; and St. Paul himself strenuously pleads for works,\nparticularly in his latter epistles. This verse is a summary of what\nfollows. What profiteth it? is enlarged on, ver. 15-17; though a man\nsay, ver. 18, 19 can that faith save him? ver. 20. It is not, though he\nhave faith; but, though he say he have faith. Here, therefore, true,\nliving faith is meant: but in other parts of the argument the apostle\nspeaks of a dead, imaginary faith. He does not, therefore, teach that\ntrue faith can, but that it cannot, subsist without works: nor does he\noppose faith to works; but that empty name of faith, to real faith\nworking by love. Can that faith \"which is without works\" save him? No\nmore than it can profit his neighbour."

And as these were an awful\nprelude of that wrath which was to fall upon them in the world to come,\nso this may likewise refer to the final vengeance which will then be\nexecuted on the impenitent."

But such sickly life, of soul or body, will end in\ndeath, and every day draw nigher to it. Health is the means of both\nnatural and spiritual growth. If the remaining evil of our fallen nature\nbe not daily mortified, it will, like an evil humour in the body,\ndestroy the whole man. But \"if ye through the Spirit do mortify the\ndeeds of the body,\" (only so far as we do this,) \"ye shall live\" the\nlife of faith, holiness, happiness. The end and design of grace being\npurchased and bestowed on us, is to destroy the image of the earthy, and\nrestore us to that of the heavenly. And so far as it does this, it truly\nprofits us; and also makes way for more of the heavenly gift, that we\nmay at last be filled with all the fulness of God. The strength and\nwell-being of a Christian depend on what his soul feeds on, as the\nhealth of the body depends on whatever we make our daily food. If we\nfeed on what is according to our nature, we grow; if not, we pine away\nand die. The soul is of the nature of God, and nothing but what is\naccording to his holiness can agree with it. Sin, of every kind, starves\nthe soul, and makes it consume away. Let us not try to invert the order\nof God in his new creation: we shall only deceive ourselves. It is easy\nto forsake the will of God, and follow our own; but this will bring\nleanness into the soul. It is easy to satisfy ourselves without being\npossessed of the holiness and happiness of the gospel. It is easy to\ncall these frames and feelings, and then to oppose faith to one and\nChrist to the other. Frames (allowing the expression) are no other than\nheavenly tempers, \"the mind that was in Christ.\" Feelings are the divine\nconsolations of the Holy Ghost shed abroad in the heart of him that\ntruly believes. And wherever faith is, and wherever Christ is, there are\nthese blessed frames and feelings. If they are not in us, it is a sure\nsign that though the wilderness became a pool, the pool is become a\nwilderness again. And in the knowledge of Christ - That is, in faith,\nthe root of all. To him be the glory to the day of eternity - An\nexpression naturally flowing from that sense which the apostle had felt\nin his soul throughout this whole chapter. Eternity is a day without\nnight, without interruption, without end."

What Bengelius has advanced, both concerning the\ntransposition of these two verses, and the authority of the controverted\nverse, partly in his \"Gnomon,\" and partly in his \"Apparatus Criticus,\"\nwill abundantly satisfy any impartial person. For there are three that\ntestify - Literally, testifying, or bearing witness. The participle is\nput for the noun witnesses, to intimate that the act of testifying, and\nthe effect of it, are continually present. Properly, persons only can\ntestify; and that three are described testifying on earth, as if they\nwere persons, is elegantly subservient to the three persons testifying\nin heaven. The Spirit - In the word, confirmed by miracles. The water -\nOf baptism, wherein we are dedicated to the Son, (with the Father and\nSpirit,) typifying his spotless purity, and the inward purifying of our\nnature. And the blood - Represented in the Lord's supper, and applied to\nthe consciences of believer.

And there are three that testify in heaven - The\ntestimony of the Spirit, the water, and the blood, is by an eminent\ngradation corroborated by three, who give a still greater testimony. The\nFather - Who clearly testified of the Son, both at his baptism and at\nhis transfiguration. The Word - Who testified of himself on many\noccasions, while he was on earth; and again, with still greater\nsolemnity, after his ascension into heaven, Rev. i, 5; Rev. xix, 13. And the Spirit - Whose testimony was added chiefly after\nhis glorification, chap. ii, 27; John xv, 26; Acts v, 32; Rom. viii, 16. And these three are one - Even as those two, the Father and\nthe Son, are one, John x, 30. Nothing can separate the Spirit from the Father and the\nSon. If he were not one with the Father and the Son, the apostle ought\nto have said, The Father and the Word, who are one, and the Spirit, are\ntwo. But this is contrary to the whole tenor of Revelation. It remains\nthat these three are one. They are one in essence, in knowledge, in\nwill, and in their testimony. It is observable, the three in the one\nverse are opposed, not conjointly, but severally, to the three in the\nother: as if he had said, Not only the Spirit testifies, but also the\nFather, John v, 37; not only the water, but also the Word, John iii, 11, John x, 41; not only the blood, but also the Holy Ghost, John xv,\n26, &c. It must now appear, to every reasonable man, how\nabsolutely necessary the eighth verse is 1 John v, 8. St. John could not think of the testimony of the Spirit,\nand water, and blood, and subjoin, \"The testimony of God is greater,\"\nwithout thinking also of the testimony of the Son and Holy Ghost; yea,\nand mentioning it in so solemn an enumeration. Nor can any possible\nreason be devised, why, without three testifying in heaven, he should\nenumerate three, and no more, who testify on earth. The testimony of all\nis given on earth, not in heaven; but they who testify are part on\nearth, part in heaven. The witnesses who are on earth testify chiefly\nconcerning his abode on earth, though not excluding his state of\nexaltation: the witnesses who are in heaven testify chiefly concerning\nhis glory at God's right hand, though not excluding his state of\nhumiliation. The seventh verse, therefore, with the sixth, contains a\nrecapitulation of the whole economy of Christ, from his baptism to\npentecost; the eighth, the sum of the divine economy, from the time of\nhis exaltation. Hence it further appears, that this position of the\nseventh 1 John\nv, 7, 8 and eighth verses, which places those who testify on earth\nbefore those who testify in heaven, is abundantly preferable to the\nother, and affords a gradation admirably suited to the subject."

              "text": "1. The Revelation - Properly so called; for things covered\nbefore are here revealed, or unveiled. No prophecy in the Old Testament\nhas this title; it was reserved for this alone in the New. It is, as it\nwere, a manifesto, wherein the Heir of all things declares that all\npower is given him in heaven and earth, and that he will in the end\ngloriously exercise that power, maugre all the opposition of all his\nenemies. Of Jesus Christ - Not of \"John the Divine,\" a title added in\nlatter ages. Certain it is, that appellation, the Divine, was not\nbrought into the church, much less was it affixed to John the apostle,\ntill long after the apostolic age. It was St. John, indeed, who wrote\nthis book, but the author of it is Jesus Christ. Which God gave unto him\n- According to his holy, glorified humanity, as the great Prophet of the\nchurch. God gave the Revelation to Jesus Christ; Jesus Christ made it\nknown to his servants. To show - This word recurs, chap. xxii, 6; and in\nmany places the parts of this book refer to each other. Indeed the whole\nstructure of it breathes the art of God, comprising, in the most\nfinished compendium, things to come, many, various; near, intermediate,\nremote; the greatest, the least; terrible, comfortable; old, new; long,\nshort; and these interwoven together, opposite, composite; relative to\neach other at a small, at a great, distance; and therefore sometimes, as\nit were, disappearing, broken off, suspended, and afterwards\nunexpectedly and most seasonably appearing again. In all its parts it\nhas an admirable variety, with the most exact harmony, beautifully\nillustrated by those very digressions which seem to interrupt it. In\nthis manner does it display the manifold wisdom of God shining in the\neconomy of the church through so many ages. His servants - Much is\ncomprehended in this appellation. It is a great thing to be a servant of\nJesus Christ. This book is dedicated particularly to the servants of\nChrist in the seven churches in Asia; but not exclusive of all his other\nservants, in all nations and ages. It is one single Revelation, and yet\nsufficient for them all, from the time it was written to the end of the\nworld. Serve thou the Lord Jesus Christ in truth: so shalt thou learn\nhis secret in this book; yea, and thou shalt feel in thy heart whether\nthis book be divine, or not. The things which must shortly come to pass\n- The things contained in this prophecy did begin to be accomplished\nshortly after it was given; and the whole might be said to come to pass\nshortly, in the same sense as St. Peter says, \"The end of all things is\nat hand;\" and our Lord himself, \"Behold, I come quickly.\" There is in\nthis book a rich treasure of all the doctrines pertaining to faith and\nholiness. But these are also delivered in other parts of holy writ; so\nthat the Revelation need not to have been given for the sake of these.\nThe peculiar design of this is, to show the things which must come to\npass. And this we are especially to have before our eyes whenever we\nread or hear it. It is said afterward, \"Write what thou seest;\" and\nagain, \"Write what thou hast seen, and what is, and what shall be\nhereafter;\" but here, where the scope of the book is shown, it is only\nsaid, the things which must come to pass. Accordingly, the showing\nthings to come, is the great point in view throughout the whole. And St.\nJohn writes what he has seen, and what is, only as it has an influence\non, or gives light to, what shall be. And he - Jesus Christ. Sent and\nsignified them - Showed them by signs or emblems; so the Greek word\nproperly means. By his angel - Peculiarly called, in the sequel, \"the\nangel of God,\" and particularly mentioned, chap. xvii, 1; xxi, 9; xxii,\n6, 16. To his servant John - A title given to no other single person\nthroughout the book."

They inquire\nafter anything rather than this; as if it were written, \"Happy is he\nthat doth not read this prophecy.\" Nay, but happy is he that readeth,\nand they that hear, and keep the words thereof - Especially at this\ntime, when so considerable a part of them is on the point of being\nfulfilled. Nor are helps wanting whereby any sincere and diligent\ninquirer may understand what he reads therein. The book itself is\nwritten in the most accurate manner possible. It distinguishes the\nseveral things whereof it treats by seven epistles, seven seals, seven\ntrumpets, seven phials; each of which sevens is divided into four and\nthree. Many things the book itself explains; as the seven stars; the\nseven candlesticks; the lamb, his seven horns and seven eyes; the\nincense; the dragon; the heads and horns of the beasts; the fine linen;\nthe testimony of Jesus: and much light arises from comparing it with the\nancient prophecies, and the predictions in the other books of the New\nTestament. In this book our Lord has comprised what was wanting in those\nprophecies touching the time which followed his ascension and the end of\nthe Jewish polity. Accordingly, it reaches from the old Jerusalem to the\nnew, reducing all things into one sum, in the exactest order, and with a\nnear resemblance to the ancient prophets. The introduction and\nconclusion agree with Daniel; the description of the man child, and the\npromises to Zion, with Isaiah; the judgment of Babylon, with Jeremiah;\nagain, the determination of times, with Daniel; the architecture of the\nholy city, with Ezekiel; the emblems of the horses, candlesticks,\n&c., with Zechariah. Many things largely described by the prophets\nare here summarily repeated; and frequently in the same words. To them\nwe may then usefully have recourse. Yet the Revelation suffices for the\nexplaining itself, even if we do not yet understand those prophecies;\nyea, it casts much light upon them. Frequently, likewise, where there is\na resemblance between them, there is a difference also; the Revelation,\nas it were, taking a stock from one of the old prophets, and inserting a\nnew graft into it. Thus Zechariah speaks of two olive trees; and so does\nSt. John; but with a different meaning. Daniel has a beast with ten\nhorns; so has St. John; but not with quite the same signification. And\nhere the difference of words, emblems, things, times, ought studiously\nto be observed. Our Lord foretold many things before his passion; but\nnot all things; for it was not yet seasonable. Many things, likewise,\nhis Spirit foretold in the writings of the apostles, so far as the\nnecessities of those times required: now he comprises them all in one\nshort book; therein presupposing all the other prophecies, and at the\nsame time explaining, continuing, and perfecting them in one thread. It\nis right therefore to compare them; but not to measure the fulness of\nthese by the scantiness of those preceding. Christ, when on earth,\nforetold what would come to pass in a short time; adding a brief\ndescription of the last things. Here he foretells the intermediate\nthings; so that both put together constitute one complete chain of\nprophecy. This book is therefore not only the sum and the key of all the\nprophecies which preceded, but likewise a supplement to all; the seals\nbeing closed before. Of consequence, it contains many particulars not\nrevealed in any other part of scripture. They have therefore little\ngratitude to God for such a Revelation, reserved for the exaltation of\nChrist, who boldly reject whatever they find here which was not\nrevealed, or not so clearly, in other parts of scripture. He that\nreadeth and they that hear - St. John probably sent this book by a\nsingle person into Asia, who read it in the churches, while many heard.\nBut this, likewise, in a secondary sense, refers to all that shall duly\nread or hear it in all ages. The words of this prophecy - It is a\nRevelation with regard to Christ who gives it; a prophecy, with regard\nto John who delivers it to the churches. And keep the things which are\nwritten therein - In such a manner as the nature of them requires;\nnamely, with repentance, faith, patience, prayer, obedience,\nwatchfulness, constancy. It behoves every Christian, at all\nopportunities, to read what is written in the oracles of God; and to\nread this precious book in particular, frequently, reverently, and\nattentively. For the time - Of its beginning to be accomplished. Is near\n- Even when St. John wrote. How much nearer to us is even the full\naccomplishment of this weighty prophecy!"

It\nsometimes is to be taken figuratively, to denote completeness or\nperfection. By these seven spirits, not seven created angels, but the\nHoly Ghost is to be understood. The angels are never termed spirits in\nthis book; and when all the angels stand up, while the four living\ncreatures and the four and twenty elders worship him that sitteth on the\nthrone, and the Lamb, the seven spirits neither stand up nor worship. To\nthese \"seven spirits of God,\" the seven churches, to whom the Spirit\nspeaks so many things, are subordinate; as are also their angels, yea,\nand \"the seven angels which stand before God.\" He is called the seven\nspirits, not with regard to his essence, which is one, but with regard\nto his manifold operations."

Of the seven angels, two, at\nEphesus and at Pergamos, were in a mixed state; two, at Sardis and at\nLaodicea, were greatly corrupted: all these are exhorted to repent; as\nare the followers of Jezebel at Thyatira: two, at Smyrna and\nPhiladelphia, were in a flourishing state, and are therefore only\nexhorted to steadfastness. There can be no state, either of any pastor,\nchurch, or single person, which has not here suitable instructions.

For the seven churches with their\nangels represent the whole Christian church, dispersed throughout the\nwhole world, as it subsists, not, as some have imagined, in one age\nafter another, but in every age. This is a point of deep importance, and\nalways necessary to be remembered: that these seven churches are, as it\nwere, a sample of the whole church of Christ, as it was then, as it is\nnow, and as it will be in all ages. Do the first works - Outwardly and\ninwardly, or thou canst never regain the first love. But if not - By\nthis word is the warning sharpened to those five churches which are\ncalled to repent; for if Ephesus was threatened, how much more shall\nSardis and Laodicea be afraid! And according as they obey the call or\nnot, there is a promise or a threatening, ver. 5, 16, 22; chap. iii, 3,\n20. But even in the threatening the promise is implied, in case of true\nrepentance. I come to thee, and will remove thy candlestick out of its\nplace - I will remove, unless thou repent, the flock now under thy care\nto another place, where they shall be better taken care of. But from the\nflourishing state of the church of Ephesus after this, there is reason\nto believe he did repent."

And they rest not - O happy unrest! Day and night - As we speak\non earth. But there is no night in heaven. And say, Holy, holy, holy -\nIs the Three-One God. There are two words in the original, very\ndifferent from each other; both which we translate holy. The one means\nproperly merciful; but the other, which occurs here, implies much more.\nThis holiness is the sum of all praise, which is given to the almighty\nCreator, for all that he does and reveals concerning himself, till the\nnew song brings with it new matter of glory. This word properly\nsignifies separated, both in Hebrew and other languages. And when God is\ntermed holy, it denotes that excellence which is altogether peculiar to\nhimself; and the glory flowing from all his attributes conjoined,\nshining forth from all his works, and darkening all things besides\nitself, whereby he is, and eternally remains, in an incomprehensible\nmanner separate and at a distance, not only from all that is impure, but\nlikewise from all that is created. God is separate from all things. He\nis, and works from himself, out of himself, in himself, through himself,\nfor himself. Therefore, he is the first and the last, the only one and\nthe Eternal, living and happy, endless and unchangeable, almighty,\nomniscient, wise and true, just and faithful, gracious and merciful.\nHence it is, that holy and holiness mean the same as God and Godhead:\nand as we say of a king, \"His Majesty;\" so the scripture says of God,\n\"His Holiness,\" Heb. xii,\n10. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. When God is spoken\nof, he is often named \"the Holy One:\" and as God swears by his name, so\nhe does also by his holiness; that is, by himself. This holiness is\noften styled glory: often his holiness and glory are celebrated\ntogether, Lev. x, 3; Isaiah vi, 3. For holiness is covered glory, and glory is uncovered\nholiness. The scripture speaks abundantly of the holiness and glory of\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And hereby is the mystery of\nthe Holy Trinity eminently confirmed. That is also termed holy which is\nconsecrated to him, and for that end separated from other things: and so\nis that wherein we may be like God, or united to him. In the hymn\nresembling this, recorded by Isaiah, Isaiah vi, 3, is added, \"The whole earth is full of his glory.\" But this\nis deferred in the Revelation, till the glory of the Lord (his enemies\nbeing destroyed) fills the earth."

It is scarce\nneedful to observe, that there is not in heaven any real book of\nparchment or paper or that Christ does not really stand there, in the\nshape of a lion or of a lamb. Neither is there on earth any monstrous\nbeast with seven heads and ten horns. But as there is upon earth\nsomething which, in its kind, answers such a representation; so there\nare in heaven divine counsels and transactions answerable to these\nfigurative expressions. All this was represented to St. John at Patmos,\nin one day, by way of vision. But the accomplishment of it extends from\nthat time throughout all ages. Writings serve to inform us of distant\nand of future things. And hence things which are yet to come are\nfiguratively said to be \"written in God's book;\" so were at that time\nthe contents of this weighty prophecy. But the book was sealed. Now\ncomes the opening and accomplishing also of the great things that are,\nas it were, the letters of it. A book written within and without - That\nis, no part of it blank, full of matter. Sealed with seven seals -\nAccording to the seven principal parts contained in it, one on the\noutside of each. The usual books of the ancients were not like ours, but\nwere volumes or long pieces of parchment, rolled upon a long stick, as\nwe frequently roll silks. Such was this represented, which was sealed\nwith seven seals. Not as if the apostle saw all the seals at once; for\nthere were seven volumes wrapped up one within another, each of which\nwas sealed: so that upon opening and unrolling the first, the second\nappeared to be sealed up till that was opened, and so on to the seventh.\nThe book and its seals represent all power in heaven and earth given to\nChrist. A copy of this book is contained in the following chapters. By\n\"the trumpets,\" contained under the seventh seal, the kingdom of the\nworld is shaken, that it may at length become the kingdom of Christ. By\n\"the vials,\" under the seventh trumpet, the power of the beast, and\nwhatsoever is connected with it, is broken. This sum of all we should\nhave continually before our eyes: so the whole Revelation flows in its\nnatural order."

This was the daily allowance\nof a slave. The Roman penny, as much as a labourer then earned in a day,\nwas about sevenpence halfpenny English. According to this, wheat would\nbe near twenty shillings per bushel. This must have been fulfilled while\nthe Grecian measure and the Roman money were still in use; as also where\nthat measure was the common measure, and this money the current coin. It\nwas so in Egypt under Trajan. And three measures of barley for a penny -\nEither barley was, in common, far cheaper among the ancients than wheat,\nor the prophecy mentions this as something peculiar. And hurt not the\noil and the wine - Let there not be a scarcity of everything. Let there\nbe some provision left to supply the want of the rest This was also\nfulfilled in the reign of Trajan, especially in Egypt, which lay\nsouthward from Patmos. In this country, which used to be the granary of\nthe empire, there was an uncommon dearth at the very beginning of his\nreign; so that he was obliged to supply Egypt itself with corn from\nother countries. The same scarcity there was in the thirteenth year of\nhis reign, the harvest failing for want of the rising of the Nile: and\nthat not only in Egypt, but in all those other parts of Afric, where the\nNile uses to overflow."

So the fourth seal\nreaches to the borders of things invisible, which are comprised in the\nthree last seals. And power was given to him over the fourth part of the\nearth - What came single and in a lower degree before, comes now\ntogether, and much more severely. The first seal brought victory with\nit: in the second was \"a great sword;\" but here a scimitar. In the third\nwas moderate dearth; here famine, and plague, and wild beasts beside.\nAnd it may well be, that from the time of Trajan downwards, the fourth\npart of men upon the earth, that is, within the Roman empire, died by\nsword, famine, pestilence, and wild beasts. \"At that time,\" says\nAurelius Victor, \"the Tyber overflowed much more fatally than under\nNerva, with a great destruction of houses and there was a dreadful\nearthquake through many provinces, and a terrible plague and famine, and\nmany places consumed by fire.\" By death - That is, by pestilence wild\nbeasts have, at several times, destroyed abundance of men; and\nundoubtedly there was given them, at this time, an uncommon fierceness\nand strength. It is observable that war brings on scarcity, and scarcity\npestilence, through want of wholesome sustenance; and pestilence, by\ndepopulating the country, leaves the few survivors an easier prey to the\nwild beasts. And thus these judgments make way for one another in the\norder wherein they are here represented. What has been already observed\nmay be a fourfold proof that the four horsemen, as with their first\nentrance in the reign of Trajan, (which does by no means exhaust the\ncontents of the four first seals,) so with all their entrances in\nsucceeding ages, and with the whole course of the world and of visible\nnature, are in all ages subject to Christ, subsisting by his power, and\nserving his will, against the wicked, and in defense of the righteous.\nHerewith, likewise, a way is paved for the trumpets which regularly\nsucceed each other; and the whole prophecy, as to what is future, is\nconfirmed by the clear accomplishment of this part of it."

And the angels here made known by these trumpets\nthe wonderful works of God, whereby all opposing powers are successively\nshaken, till the kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of God and his\nAnointed. These trumpets reach nearly from the time of St. John to the\nend of the world; and they are distinguished by manifest tokens.

Quickly after the Revelation was given, the\nJewish calamities under Adrian began: yea, before the reign of Trajan\nwas ended. And here the trumpets begin. Even under Trajan, in the year\n114, the Jews made an insurrection with a most dreadful fury; and in the\nparts about Cyrene, in Egypt, and in Cyprus, destroyed four hundred and\nsixty thousand persons. But they were repressed by the victorious power\nof Trajan, and afterward slaughtered themselves in vast multitudes. The\nalarm spread itself also into Mesopotamia, where Lucius Quintius slew a\ngreat number of them. They rose in Judea again in the second year of\nAdrian; but were presently quelled. Yet in 133 they broke out more\nviolently than ever, under their false messiah Barcochab; and the war\ncontinued till the year 135, when almost all Judea was desolated. In the\nEgyptian plague also hail and fire were together. But here hail is to be\ntaken figuratively, as also blood, for a vehement, sudden, powerful,\nhurtful invasion; and fire betokens the revenge of an enraged enemy,\nwith the desolation therefrom. And they were cast upon the earth - That\nis, the fire and hail and blood. But they existed before they were cast\nupon the earth. The storm fell, the blood flowed, and the flames raged\nround Cyrene, and in Egypt, and Cyprus, before they reached Mesopotamia\nand Judea. And the third part of the earth was burnt up - Fifty well-\nfortified cities, and nine hundred and eighty-five well-inhabited towns\nof the Jews, were wholly destroyed in this war. Vast tracts of land were\nlikewise left desolate and without inhabitant. And the third part of the\ntrees was burned up, and all the green grass was burned up - Some\nunderstand by the trees, men of eminence among the Jews; by the grass,\nthe common people. The Roman spared many of the former: the latter were\nalmost all destroyed. Thus vengeance began at the Jewish enemies of\nChrist's kingdom; though even then the Roman did not quite escape.

And the rest - The remaining sixty-three thousand were converted: a\ngrand step toward the fulfilling of the mystery of God. Such a\nconversion we no where else read of.

When the whole\nmultitude gives glory to the God of heaven, then that \"treading of the\nholy city\" ceases. This is the point so long aimed at, the desired\n\"fulfilling of the mystery of God,\" when the divine promises are so\nrichly fulfilled on those who have gone through so great afflictions.\nAll this is here related together, that whereas the first and second woe\nwent forth in the east, the rest of the eastern affairs being added at\nonce, the description of the western might afterwards remain unbroken.\nIt may be useful here to see how the things here spoken of, and those\nhereafter described, follow each other in their order."

God has not given\nthis prophecy, in so solemn a manner, only to show his providence over\nhis church, but also that his servants may know at all times in what\nparticular period they are. And the more dangerous any period of time\nis, the greater is the help which it affords. But where may we fix the\nbeginning and end of the little time? which is probably four-fifths of a\nchronos, or somewhat above 888 years. This, which is the time of the\nthird woe, may reach from 947, to the year 1836. For,"

A wild beast\ncoming up - He comes up twice; first from the sea, then from the abyss.\nHe comes from the sea before the seven phials; \"the great whore\" comes\nafter them. O reader, this is a subject wherein we also are deeply\nconcerned, and which must be treated, not as a point of curiosity, but\nas a solemn warning from God! The danger is near. Be armed both against\nforce and fraud, even with the whole armour of God. Out of the sea -\nThat is, Europe. So the three woes (the first being in Persia, the\nsecond about the Euphrates) move in a line from east to west. This beast\nis the Romish Papacy, as it came to a point six hundred years since,\nstands now, and will for some time longer. To this, and no other power\non earth, agrees the whole text, and every part of it in every point; as\nwe may see, with the utmost evidence, from the propositions following: -\nPROP. 1. It is one and the same beast, having seven heads, and ten\nhorns, which is described in this and in the seventeenth chapter. Of\nconsequence, his heads are the same, and his horns also. PROP. 2. This\nbeast is a spiritually secular power, opposite to the kingdom of Christ.\nA power not merely spiritual or ecclesiastical, nor merely secular or\npolitical but a mixture of both. He is a secular prince; for a crown,\nyea, and a kingdom are ascribed to him. And yet he is not merely\nsecular; for he is also a false prophet. PROP. 3. The beast has a strict\nconnection with the city of Rome. This clearly appears from the\nseventeenth chapter. PROP. 4. The beast is now existing. He is not past.\nfor Rome is now existing; and it is not till after the destruction of\nRome that the beast is thrown into the lake. He is not altogether to\ncome: for the second woe is long since past, after which the third came\nquickly; and presently after it began, the beast rose out of the sea.\nTherefore, whatever he is, he is now existing. PROP. 5. The beast is the\nRomish Papacy. This manifestly follows from the third and fourth\npropositions; the beast has a strict connection with the city of Rome;\nand the beast is now existing: therefore, either there is some other\npower more strictly connected with that city, or the Pope is the beast.\nPROP. 6. The Papacy, or papal kingdom, began long ago. The most\nremarkable particulars relating to this are here subjoined; taken so\nhigh as abundantly to show the rise of the beast, and brought down as\nlow as our own time, in order to throw a light on the following part of\nthe prophecy: A.D. 1033. Benedict the Ninth, a child of eleven years\nold, is bishop of Rome, and occasions grievous disorders for above\ntwenty years. A.D. 1048. Damasus II. introduces the use of the triple\ncrown. A.D. 1058. The church of Milan is, after long opposition,\nsubjected to the Roman. A.D. 1073. Hildebrand, or Gregory VII., comes to\nthe throne. A.D. 1076. He deposes and excommunicates the emperor. A.D.\n1077. He uses him shamefully and absolves him. A.D. 1080. He\nexcommunicates him again, and sends a crown to Rodulph, his competitor.\nA.D. 1083. Rome is taken. Gregory flees. Clement is made Pope, and\ncrowns the emperor. A.D. 1085. Gregory VII. dies at Salerno. A.D. 1095.\nUrban II. holds the first Popish council, at Clermont and gives rise to\nthe crusades. A.D. 1111. Paschal II. quarrels furiously with the\nemperor. A.D. 1123. The first western general council in the Lateran.\nThe marriage of priests is forbidden. A.D. 1132. Innocent II declares\nthe emperor to be the Pope's liege-man, or vassal. A.D. 1143. The Roman\nset up a governor of their own, independent on Innocent II. He\nexcommunicates them, and dies. Celestine II. is, by an important\ninnovation, chosen to the Popedom without the suffrage of the people;\nthe right of choosing the Pope is taken from the people, and afterward\nfrom the clergy, and lodged in the Cardinals alone. A.D. 1152. Eugene\nII. assumes the power of canonizing saints. A.D. 1155. Adrian IV. puts\nArnold of Brixia to death for speaking against the secular power of the\nPapacy. A.D. 1159. Victor IV. is elected and crowned. But Alexander III.\nconquers him and his successor. A.D. 1168. Alexander III. excommunicates\nthe emperor, and brings him so low, that, A.D. 1177. he submits to the\nPope's setting his foot on his neck. A.D. 1204. Innocent III. sets up\nthe Inquisition against the Vaudois. A.D. 1208. He proclaims a crusade\nagainst them. A.D. 1300. Boniface VIII. introduces the year of jubilee.\nA.D. 1305. The Pope's residence is removed to Avignon. A.D. 1377. It is\nremoved back to Rome. A.D. 1378. The fifty years' schism begins. A.D.\n1449. Felix V., the last Antipope, submits to Nicholas V. A.D. 1517. The\nReformation begins. A.D. 1527. Rome is taken and plundered. A.D. 1557.\nCharles V. resigns the empire; Ferdinand I. thinks the being crowned by\nthe Pope superfluous. A.D. 1564. Pius IV. confirms the Council of Trent.\nA.D. 1682. Doctrines highly derogatory to the Papal authority are openly\ntaught in France. A.D. 1713. The constitution Unigenitus. A.D. 1721.\nPope Gregory VII. canonized anew. He who compares this short table with\nwhat will be observed, verse 3, and chap. xvii, 10, will see that the\nascent of the beast out of the sea must needs be fixed toward the\nbeginning of it; and not higher than Gregory VII., nor lower than\nAlexander III. The secular princes now favoured the kingdom of Christ;\nbut the bishops of Rome vehemently opposed it. These at first were plain\nministers or pastors of the Christian congregation at Rome, but by\ndegrees they rose to an eminence of honour and power over all their\nbrethren till, about the time of Gregory VII. (and so ever since) they\nassumed all the ensigns of royal majesty; yea, of a majesty and power\nfar superior to that of all other potentates on earth. We are not here\nconsidering their false doctrines, but their unbounded power. When we\nthink of those, we are to look at the false prophet, who is also termed\na wild beast at his ascent out of the earth. But the first beast then\nproperly arose, when, after several preludes thereto, the Pope raised\nhimself above the emperor. PROP. 7. Hildebrand, or Gregory VII., is the\nproper founder of the papal kingdom. All the patrons of the Papacy allow\nthat he made many considerable additions to it; and this very thing\nconstituted the beast, by completing the spiritual kingdom: the new\nmaxims and the new actions of Gregory all proclaim this. Some of his\nmaxims are,"

Hitherto the Popes had\nbeen subject to the emperors, though often unwillingly; but now the Pope\nbegan himself, under a spiritual pretext, to act the emperor of the\nwhole Christian world: the immediate dispute was, about the investiture\nof bishops, the right of which each claimed to himself. And now was the\ntime for the Pope either to give up, or establish his empire forever: to\ndecide which, Gregory excommunicated the emperor Henry IV.; \"having\nfirst,\" says Platina, \"deprived him of all his dignities.\" The sentence\nran in these terms: \"Blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, incline, I\nbeseech thee, thine ears, and hear me thy servant. In the name of the\nomnipotent God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I cast down the emperor\nHenry from all imperial and regal authority, and absolve all Christians,\nthat were his subjects, from the oath whereby they used to swear\nallegiance to true kings. And moreover, because he had despised mine,\nyea, thy admonitions, I bind him with the bond of an anathema.\" The same\nsentence he repeated at Rome in these terms: \"Blessed Peter, prince of\nthe apostles, and thou Paul, teacher of the gentiles, incline, I beseech\nyou, your ears to me, and graciously hear me. Henry, whom they call\nemperor, hath proudly lifted up his horns and his head against the\nchurch of God, - who came to me, humbly imploring to be absolved from\nhis excommunication, - I restored him to communion, but not to his\nkingdom, - neither did I allow his subjects to return to their\nallegiance. Several bishops and princes of Germany, taking this\nopportunity, in the room of Henry, justly deposed, chose Rodulph\nemperor, who immediately sent ambassadors to me, informing me that he\nwould rather obey me than accept of a kingdom, and that he should always\nremain at the disposal of God and us. Henry then began to be angry, and\nat first intreated us to hinder Rodulph from seizing his kingdom. I said\nI would see to whom the right belonged, and give sentence which should\nbe preferred. Henry forbad this. Therefore I bind Henry and all his\nfavourers with the bond of an anathema, and again take from him all\nregal power. I absolve all Christians from their oath of allegiance,\nforbid them to obey Henry in anything, and command them to receive\nRodulph as their king. Confirm this, therefore, by your authority, ye\nmost holy princes of the apostles, that all may now at length know, as\nye have power to bind and loose in heaven, so we have power to give and\ntake away on earth, empires, kingdoms, principalities, and whatsoever\nmen can have.\" When Henry submitted, then Gregory began to reign without\ncontrol. In the same year, 1077, on September 1, he fixed a new era of\ntime, called the Indiction, used at Rome to this day. Thus did the Pope\nclaim to himself the whole authority over all Christian princes. Thus\ndid he take away or confer kingdoms and empires, as a king of kings.\nNeither did his successors fail to tread in his steps. It is well known,\nthe following Popes have not been wanting to exercise the same power,\nboth over kings and emperors. And this the later Popes have been so far\nfrom disclaiming, that three of them have sainted this very Gregory,\nnamely, Clement VIII., Paul V., and Benedict XIII. Here is then the\nbeast, that is, the king: in fact such, though not in name: according to\nthat remarkable observation of Cardinal Bellarmine, \"Antichrist will\ngovern the Roman empire, yet without the name of Roman emperor.\" His\nspiritual title prevented his taking the name, while he exerciseth all\nthe power. Now Gregory was at the head of this novelty. So Aventine\nhimself, \"Gregory VII was the first founder of the pontifical empire.\"\nThus the time of the ascent of the beast is clear. The apostasy and\nmystery of iniquity gradually increased till he arose, \"who opposeth and\nexalteth himself above all.\" 2 Thess.\nii, 4. Before the seventh trumpet the adversary wrought more\nsecretly; but soon after the beginning of this, the beast openly opposes\nhis kingdom to the kingdom of Christ. PROP 8. The empire of Hildebrand\nproperly began in the year 1077. Then it was, that upon the emperor's\nleaving Italy, Gregory exercised his power to the full. And on the first\nof September, in this year, he began his famous epocha. This may be\nfarther established and explained by the following observations:-"

He places himself and St. John in the\nmiddlemost time, that he might the more commodiously point out the first\ntime as past, the second as present, the third as future. OBS. 9.

The\nbeast reigns both before and after the reign of Babylon. First, the\nbeast reigns, chap. xiii, 1, &c.; then Babylon, chap. xvii, 1,\n&c.; and then the beast again, chap. xvii, 8, &c. OBS. 12. The\nheads are of the substance of the beast; the horns are not. The wound of\none of the heads is called \"the wound of the beast\" itself, verse 3; but\nthe horns, or kings, receive the kingdom \"with the beast,\" chap. xvii,\n12. That word alone, \"the horns and the beast,\" chap. xvii, 16,\nsufficiently shows them to be something added to him. OBS. 13. The\nforty-two months of the beast fall within the first of the three\nperiods. The beast rose out of the sea in the year 1077. A little after,\npower was given him for forty-two months. This power is still in being.\nOBS. 14. The time when the beast \"is not,\" and the reign of \"Babylon,\"\nare together. The beast, when risen out of the sea, raged violently,\ntill \"his kingdom was darkened\" by the fifth phial. But it was a kingdom\nstill; and the beast having a kingdom, though darkened, was the beast\nstill. But it was afterwards said, \"the beast was,\" (was the beast, that\nis, reigned,) \"and is not;\" is not the beast; does not reign, having\nlost his kingdom. Why? because \"the woman sits upon the beast,\" who\n\"sits a queen,\" reigning over the kings of the earth: till the beast,\nrising out of the abyss, and taking with him the ten kings, suddenly\ndestroys her. OBS. 15. The difference there is between Rome and the\nPope, which has always subsisted, will then be most apparent. Rome,\ndistinct from the Pope, bears three meanings; the city itself, the Roman\nchurch, and the people of Rome. In the last sense of the word, Rome with\nits dutchy, which contained part of Tuscany and Campania, revolted from\nthe Greek emperor in 726, and became a free state, governed by its\nsenate. From this time the senate, and not the Pope, enjoyed the supreme\ncivil power. But in 796, Leo III., being chosen Pope, sent to Charles\nthe Great, desiring him to come and subdue the senate and people of\nRome, and constrain them to swear allegiance to him. Hence arose a sharp\ncontention between the Pope and the Roman people, who seized and thrust\nhim into a monastery. He escaped and fled to the emperor, who quickly\nsent him back in great state. In the year 800 the emperor came to Rome,\nand shortly after, the Roman people, who had hitherto chosen their own\nbishops, and looked upon themselves and their senate as having the same\nrights with the ancient senate and people of Rome, chose Charles for\ntheir emperor, and subjected themselves to him, in the same manner as\nthe ancient Roman did to their emperors. The Pope crowned him, and paid\nhim homage on his knees, as was formerly done to the Roman emperors: and\nthe emperor took an oath \"to defend the holy Roman church in all its\nemoluments.\" He was also created consul, and styled himself\nthenceforward Augustus, Emperor of the Romans. Afterwards he gave the\ngovernment of the city and dutchy of Rome to the Pope, yet still subject\nto himself. What the Roman church is, as distinct from the Pope,\nappears,"

This is the name of Papa or Pope; not in the innocent\nsense wherein it was formerly given to all bishops, but in that high and\npeculiar sense wherein it is now given to the bishop of Rome by himself,\nand his followers: a name which comprises the whole pre- eminence of the\nhighest and most holy father upon earth. Accordingly among the above\ncited sayings of Gregory, those two stand together, that his \"name alone\nshould be recited in the churches;\" and that it is \"the only name in the\nworld.\" So both the church and the world were to name no other father on\nthe face of the earth."

Babylon was first, Rome\nafterwards, the residence of the emperors of the world. What Babylon was\nto Israel of old, Roman hath been both to the literal and spiritual\n\"Israel of God.\" Hence the liberty of the ancient Jews was connected\nwith the overthrow of the Babylonish empire. And when Rome is finally\noverthrown, then the people of God will be at liberty. Whenever Babylon\nis mentioned in this book, the great is added, to teach us that Rome\nthen commenced Babylon, when it commenced the great city; when it\nswallowed up the Grecian monarchy and its fragments, Syria in\nparticular; and, in consequence of this, obtained dominion over\nJerusalem about sixty years before the birth of Christ. Then it began,\nbut it will not cease to be Babylon till it is finally destroyed. Its\nspiritual greatness began in the fifth century, and increased from age\nto age. It seems it will come to its utmost height just before its final\noverthrow. Her fornication is her idolatry; invocation of saints and\nangels; worship of images; human traditions; with all that outward pomp,\nyea, and that fierce and bloody zeal, wherewith she pretends to serve\nGod. But with spiritual fornication, as elsewhere, so in Rome, fleshly\nfornication is joined abundantly. Witness the stews there, licensed by\nthe Pope, which are no inconsiderable branch of his revenue. This is\nfitly compared, to wine, because of its intoxicating nature. Of this\nwine she hath, indeed, made all nations drink - More especially by her\nlater missions. We may observe, this making them drink is not ascribed\nto the beast, but to Babylon. For Rome itself, the Roman inquisitions,\ncongregations, and Jesuits, continually propagate the idolatrous\ndoctrines and practices, with or without the consent of this or that\nPope, who himself is not secure from their censure."

Both proceed from the power of God, and in\nboth he is glorified. And none - Not even of those who ordinarily stood\nbefore God. Could go into the temple - That is, into the inmost part of\nit.

These were the Palatine,\nCapitoline, Coelian, Exquiline, Viminal, Quirinal, Aventine hills. But\nthe prophecy respects the seven hills at the time of the beast, when the\nPalatine was deserted and the Vatican in use. Not that the seven heads\nmean hills distinct from kings; but they have a compound meaning,\nimplying both together. Perhaps the first head of the beast is the\nCoelian hill, and on it the Lateran, with Gregory VII. and his\nsuccessors; the second, the Vatican with the church of St. Peter, chosen\nby Boniface VIII. the third, the Quirinal, with the church of St. Mark,\nand the Quirinal palace built by Paul II. and the fourth, the Exquiline\nhill, with the temple of St. Maria Maggiore, where Paul V. reigned. The\nfifth will be added hereafter. Accordingly, in the papal register, four\nperiods are observable since Gregory VII. In the first almost all the\nbulls made in the city are dated in the Lateran; in the second, at St.\nPeter's; in the third, at St. Mark's, or in the Quirinal; in the fourth,\nat St. Maria Maggiore. But no fifth, sixth, or seventh hill has yet been\nthe residence of any Pope. Not that the hill was deserted, when another\nwas made the papal residence; but a new one was added to the other\nsacred palaces. Perhaps the times hitherto mentioned might be fixed\nthus:- 1058. Wings are given to the woman. 1077. The beast ascends out\nof the sea. 1143. The forty-two months begin. 1810. The forty-two\nmonths end. 1832. The beast ascends out of the bottomless pit. 1836. The\nbeast finally overthrown. The fall of those five kings seems to imply,\nnot only the death of the Popes who reigned on those hills, but also\nsuch a disannulling of all they had done there, that it will be said,\nThe beast is not; the royal power, which had so long been lodged in the\nPope, being then transferred to the city. One is, the other is not yet\ncome - These two are remarkably distinguished from the five preceding,\nwhom they succeed in their turns. The former of them will continue not a\nshort space, as may be gathered from what is said of the latter: the\nformer is under the government of Babylon; the latter is with the beast.\nIn this second period, one is, at the same time that the beast is not.\nEven then there will be a Pope, though not with the power which his\npredecessors had. And he will reside on one of the remaining hills,\nleaving the seventh for his successor."
